# A-cloud-detection-method-based-on-feature-fusion-via-PCA
This is a MATLAB code for cirrus detection in remote sensing images.

This is based on our paper "River detection based on feature fusion from synthetic aperture radar images" but has some changes in my final PhD thesis.

I change the method for computing the features and fusion for cloud detection.

If you find problems or mistakes pls contact me!

Thanks and best!
